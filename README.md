# PID
## What is the purpose of my project
-  To design an instrument used by me to regulate the speed of a balance beam trying to get a ball to level out as quickley as possible, and by using pid code and other process variables in industrial control systems to help make the PID work as smoothly as possible.

# Why did I choose to do this project
- At the beginning of this project David Deirof put me to the task of reaserching the best meathod of PID to create. Reaserching had been very dificult until I realized that in order to create a solid simple pid within the deadline set I needed to create a ballance and it was the best decision I could have possibly made. Working by myself has been the hardest challange of all because i've never worked alone on any project befor. So looking at David Dierofs project I decided to create a smaller scale simple and sleek design and overall it worked. 

# The planning stage 
In order to complete this task quickly and efficiently as possible I needed to plan out a time frame.
## The First Week 
- The first week was the core for the planning stage reaserching videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFTJ2SS4xyA ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOPTksabdbM, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h1OtBgMqcE) and looking at David Deirof's project to come to a good understanding what PID actually is and how it works on a balance.
