# PID
## What is the purpose of my project
-  To design an instrument used by me to regulate the speed of a balance beam trying to get a ball to level out as quickley as possible, and by using pid code and other process variables in industrial control systems to help make the PID work as smoothly as possible.

# Why did I choose to do this project
- At the beginning of this project David Deirof put me to the task of reaserching the best meathod of PID to create. Reaserching had been very dificult until I realized that in order to create a solid simple pid within the deadline set I needed to create a ballance and it was the best decision I could have possibly made. Working by myself has been the hardest challange of all because i've never worked alone on any project befor. So looking at David Dierofs project I decided to create a smaller scale simple and sleek design and overall it worked. 

# The planning stage 
In order to complete this task quickly and efficiently as possible I needed to plan out a time frame.
## The First Week 
- The first week was the core for the planning stage reaserching videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFTJ2SS4xyA ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOPTksabdbM, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h1OtBgMqcE) and looking at David Deirof's project to come to a good understanding what PID actually is and how it works on a balance.

# This is video proof of my balance beam in action

- The goal of the balance is to get it to reacch the midpoint as fast as possible using pid and ive gotten it to level out within a 20 second time frame VERY COOL!

-In this image it is showing you that I used a slip tie knot and connected it to the botton of one of my end cap peices and the other is conected to the ultrasonic sensor and with both of those end peices connected to a lazer cute 2 inch by 14 inch peice of acrilic made up what I called (ball holder)

- In this image it is showing the blue connection peice I desighned in order to hold the balance up I desighned this to let the ball move from about 300 degrees in total and the rod that the blue peice is conected to hold the balance up high enough so that the ballance has more room to work with.

-In this image ot shows the base i desighned to structure my whole project around I designed it in a circle because I knew i wanted all of the sides to get the same amount of force and I could base the rest of the desighn around it. In addition to that I also created an exension to that and it helped hold the 180 servo that would later be conected to the sring down. I desighned 2 peices for that a solid base for the arduino to sit on and the peice overtop to clamp it down to the acrillic.

-In this image it shows the the wiring I used conected to the arduino in addition to the breadboard I put ontop of that. Beside that is the battery holder i used using 9 vols to power my arduino is essential in the project that I am trying to complete.
